## 📝 Project Overview

This project explores key predictors of dairy cow productivity — namely, milk yield and likelihood of a second calving — using a real-world dataset of over 400,000 pedigree heifers. The analysis uses:

- **Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)** to capture non-linear trends in milk yield based on Age at First Calving (AFC) and Somatic Cell Count (SCC).
- **Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers** to predict whether a heifer will go on to have a second calf.

This work is grounded in the real-world priorities of **Precision Livestock Farming (PLF)** and aims to support practical on-farm decision-making through data science tools.
